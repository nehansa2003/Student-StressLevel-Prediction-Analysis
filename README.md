# **Student Stress Level Prediction – Machine Learning Project**


This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting student stress levels using regression, classification, model tuning, and explainable AI techniques. The project analyzes various academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors that contribute to student stress and builds a robust prediction system using Random Forest with GridSearchCV optimization.

The goal of this project is to predict student stress levels using multiple derived features and then classify them into stress categories (Healthy, Moderate, High). Along with prediction, the project emphasizes interpretability, ensuring every prediction is transparent and explainable.
